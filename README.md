## Project Overview

This project is an automated scheduling system for IIIT Dharwad that:

* Creates class timetables and exam schedules from the provided inputs.
* Enforces hard constraints (no overlapping classes, faculty availability, room capacity).
* Prioritizes soft constraints (3-hour gap for faculty, same-day labs+lectures).
* Produces a color-coded timetable UI and can export/sync to Google Calendar.

---

## Tech Stack

* Frontend: React + TailwindCSS
* Backend: Node.js / Express
* Database: PostgreSQL
* Algorithms: Constraint Satisfaction / Local Search
* Deployment: Docker

---

## Key Features

* Lecture slot limit: max **one lecture per day per course**.
* 10-minute refresh breaks after each class.
* Lunch break aligned with mess timings.
* Color coding for each course.
* Lab sessions scheduled on the **same day** as the course lecture.
* Electives scheduled in a common slot across departments.
* Self-study blocks allocation.
* Professor and room availability tracker.
* Rescheduling support when faculty/room becomes unavailable.
* Export to CSV / PDF and sync with Google Calendar.

## Functional & Non-Functional Requirements Mapping

**Functional**

* Lecture Slot Limit → ≤1 lecture/day/course.
* Short Breaks (10-min) → After each class.
* Lunch Break → Configurable.
* Lab scheduling same-day → `lab_day(course) == lecture_day(course)`.
* Electives common slot → Pre-chosen time window.
* Track availability → Faculty and room inputs considered.
* Rescheduling → Local repair heuristics applied.

**Non-Functional**

* Usability → User-friendly, role-based UI.
* Performance → Scheduler runs within seconds.
* Scalability → Modular + DB-backed for multiple departments.
* Reliability → Conflict-free generation.
* Maintainability → Editable config rules.
* Accessibility → Responsive UI.
* Security → Role-based auth, sensitive data protection.
* Portability → Runs on Windows/Linux/macOS.
* Backup & Recovery → Automatic DB and export backups.

## Architecture & Flow

1. **Input Layer** — JSON/CSV upload + manual forms.
2. **Preprocessor** — Validates inputs, expands LTPSC.
3. **Constraint Engine** — Hard & soft constraints.
4. **Scheduler** — Greedy + local search / repair algorithm.
5. **Renderer** — Color-coded timetable + exports.
6. **Sync Module** — Google Calendar / iCal.
7. **Audit & Logs** — Tracks changes and versioning.

## Installation & Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/automated-timetable-iiit-dharwad.git
cd automated-timetable-iiit-dharwad

# Server
cd server
npm install
npm run dev   # http://localhost:5000

# Client
cd ../client
npm install
npm start     # http://localhost:3000
```

Populate `data/` with JSONs and upload via UI or API call:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @data/courses.json
```

---

## Usage Examples

* Upload JSON files via Admin → Data Upload.
* Click **Generate Timetable**.
* Export: **PDF**, **CSV**, **Google Calendar**.
